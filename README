This directory contains the working scripts needed to make
the font metrics which form the CTAN fonts/psfonts directory.

These scripts were originally Unix shell scripts.  Many changes to the
scripts were made with Piet to get proper checksums in the fonts, and
make the system more understandable and reliable. They were then
converted to Perl in January 1997 as part of a radical revision, and
they are now hopefully useable. There should be almost no
Unix-dependent material here.

The makefile gives examples of their usage, or you
can start reading make-fam.pl, most of whose work is done
by subroutines in famtool.pl.

Volunteers to turn this into a serious Perl tool, and to
document it, are very welcome!
